# sorting-comparison

This program compares a bubble sort, quicksort, heap sort, and insertion sort by the amount of swaps that need to be 
performed. The main file creates a random array of numbers and then sorts it. The original array, sorted array as well 
as a count of how many swaps each sorting algorithm took to perform the sort is printed. 

This program is currently not effective for sorting strings because strig values are sorted by their ascii value 
instead of their character value.
